# Attack of the Gempire: Crystalis Seige

First major game project I lead and helped write.

The design plan was lead by myself, and the majority of the basic inital game function was coded by myself.

Teammates-
Sam: Artist
Nick: Enemy patterns (and other reliant functions)
Kevin: Supporting Artist
